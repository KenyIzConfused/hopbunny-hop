## Project Management

| Tool               | Description                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `launch_editor`    | Open the Godot editor GUI for a project                                                                                                                                                 |
| `run_project`      | Run a project and inject the MCP bridge. Pass `background: true` to hide the window; pass `bridgePort` (integer 1–65535) to pin the bridge port — auto-selects a free port when omitted |
| `attach_project`   | Inject the MCP bridge for a project you'll launch yourself. Pass `bridgePort` (integer 1–65535) to pin a specific port — auto-selects a free port when omitted                          |
| `detach_project`   | Remove the injected bridge after manual-launch use, leaving the external process alone                                                                                                  |
| `stop_project`     | Stop the running project and remove the bridge (also detaches attached-mode state)                                                                                                      |
| `get_debug_output` | Read stdout/stderr from an MCP-spawned project (unavailable in attached mode)                                                                                                           |
| `list_projects`    | Find Godot projects in a directory                                                                                                                                                      |
| `get_project_info` | Get project metadata and Godot version                                                                                                                                                  |

## Runtime (requires `run_project` or `attach_project` first)

Both `run_project` and `attach_project` wait for the bridge before returning success, so runtime tools are usable immediately after the call returns. `attach_project` waits up to 15 s for the externally launched Godot process to come up. If you (the agent) are launching Godot yourself, kick the launch off in parallel with `attach_project` so the wait absorbs Godot's startup — don't sequentialize. If a human is launching Godot and they don't make it inside the window, retry `attach_project` (`bridge.inject` is idempotent). Both `run_project` and `attach_project` auto-select a free bridge port when `bridgePort` is omitted; pass `bridgePort` to pin a specific port.

| Tool              | Description                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `take_screenshot` | Capture a PNG; defaults to a 960x540 inline preview. Use `responseMode: "full"` for pixel-perfect, `"path_only"` for path metadata only |
| `simulate_input`  | Send batched input: key, mouse_button, mouse_motion, click_element, action, wait                                                        |
| `get_ui_elements` | Get all visible Control nodes with positions, types, and text                                                                           |
| `run_script`      | Execute arbitrary GDScript at runtime with full SceneTree access                                                                        |

`take_screenshot` defaults to `responseMode: "preview"` — the full PNG is saved to `.mcp/screenshots/` and a 960x540-bounded preview is returned inline. Use `"full"` for pixel-level inspection or `"path_only"` to skip the inline image.

## Scene Editing (headless)

All mutation operations save automatically. Use `save_scene` only for save-as (`newPath`) or to re-canonicalize a `.tscn` file.

| Tool                     | Description                                                          |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `create_scene`           | Create a new scene file                                              |
| `add_node`               | Add a node to an existing scene (supports promoted spatial params)   |
| `load_sprite`            | Set a texture on a Sprite2D, Sprite3D, or TextureRect                |
| `save_scene`             | Re-pack and save the scene, or save-as with `newPath`                |
| `export_mesh_library`    | Export scenes as a MeshLibrary for GridMap                           |
| `batch_scene_operations` | Run multiple add_node/load_sprite/save ops in a single Godot process |

## Node Editing (headless)

All mutation operations save automatically. Property and delete tools take always-array input — pass a single-element array for one-off operations, or many for batched work in one Godot process.

| Tool                  | Description                                                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `get_scene_tree`      | Get the full scene tree hierarchy (use `maxDepth: 1` for shallow listing) |
| `get_node_properties` | Read properties from one or more nodes (always-array `nodes`)             |
| `set_node_properties` | Set properties on one or more nodes (always-array `updates`)              |
| `attach_script`       | Attach a GDScript to a node                                               |
| `duplicate_node`      | Duplicate a node within the scene                                         |
| `delete_nodes`        | Remove one or more nodes from the scene (always-array `nodePaths`)        |
| `get_node_signals`    | List all signals on a node with their connections                         |
| `connect_signal`      | Connect a signal to a method on another node                              |
| `disconnect_signal`   | Disconnect a signal connection                                            |

## Property Values (`add_node`, `set_node_properties`)

Both tools take JSON property values and assign them through the same validated path. `node.set()` casts through the property's typed setter with no validity return, so an incompatible value would silently store the declared type's zero value (a string on an int stores `0`, a dict on a Resource clears it). Every value is therefore checked against the property's declared type first, and a mismatch errors instead of reporting a write that did not land.

### Automatic conversions

| Input                        | Becomes                     |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `{x, y}`                     | `Vector2`                   |
| `{x, y, z}`                  | `Vector3`                   |
| `{r, g, b}` / `{r, g, b, a}` | `Color` (`a` defaults to 1) |

A property whose declared type is `Dictionary` skips this coercion, so a dict with `x`/`y` or `r`/`g`/`b` keys is stored as a plain `Dictionary`.

### Accepted widening conversions

Godot performs these on store, so they are allowed: float to int, string to `NodePath` or `StringName`, bool to int or float, `Vector2` to `Vector2i` (and back), `Vector3` to `Vector3i` (and back), and `Array` to any `Packed*Array`. Everything else errors.

### Object-typed properties

Properties declared as a `Resource` or `Node` (for example `CollisionShape2D.shape`, `Sprite2D.texture`) reject plain values. They accept one of three forms:

| Form                                | Behavior                                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `"res://path/to/file.tres"`         | Loads the saved resource. Errors if the path does not exist or the asset has not been imported. |
| `{ "type": "ClassName", ...props }` | Constructs the Resource inline via `ClassDB.instantiate`, then assigns each inner property.     |
| `null`                              | Clears the property.                                                                            |

Inline construction example:

```json
{ "shape": { "type": "RectangleShape2D", "size": { "x": 80, "y": 16 } } }
```

Inner properties are assigned through the same validation described above, so nested typed dicts and nested `res://` paths both work at any depth. The scene is persisted with `PackedScene.pack()`, so a constructed Resource is written out as a normal `[sub_resource]` block.

Construction errors are explicit and nothing is persisted when one fires:

- `type` names an unknown class
- `type` names a class that is not a `Resource` subclass
- `type` names an abstract or native-only class that cannot be instantiated
- the constructed class does not satisfy the property's declared resource hint (for example a `RectangleShape2D` assigned to `Sprite2D.texture`)
- an inner property does not exist on the constructed class, or its value fails the type check (the error names the inner property)

## Project Config (no Godot process required)

These tools edit `project.godot` directly or read the filesystem. Safe to use even when autoloads are broken.

| Tool                     | Description                                                          |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `list_autoloads`         | List all registered autoloads with paths and singleton status        |
| `add_autoload`           | Register a new autoload                                              |
| `remove_autoload`        | Unregister an autoload by name                                       |
| `update_autoload`        | Modify an existing autoload's path or singleton flag                 |
| `get_project_settings`   | Read settings from `project.godot`, optionally filtered by `section` |
| `get_project_files`      | Get the project file tree with types and extensions                  |
| `search_project`         | Search for a string across project source files                      |
| `get_scene_dependencies` | List all resources a scene depends on                                |

## Validation: `validate`

Validate before attaching or running. Catches syntax errors and missing resource references before they cause headless crashes or runtime failures. Supports `scriptPath`, `source` (inline GDScript), `scenePath`, or a `targets` array for batch validation.
